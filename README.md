# FGF Hackathon Solutions

## Overview
This was a co-op event held by FGF Brands. It provided a great opportunity to meet many people and learn a lot. Our team tackled various challenges, applying AI and automation to improve scheduling, email management, and user interaction.

## Problem 1: Meeting Scheduling Automation

### Objective
Develop an AI algorithm that schedules meetings with listed individuals and automatically selects an available meeting room based on the number of attendees.

### Solution
**RoomMate**
- **Algorithm:** RoomMate automates the process of scheduling meetings and selecting rooms. It takes user inputs such as attendee names, emails, number of attendees, date, time, and duration.
- **Room Selection:** The system uses predefined rooms with their capacities and checks room availability using the Outlook calendar.
- **Booking:** If a suitable room is found, RoomMate creates a new appointment and sends meeting invites to the attendees.

## Problem 3: Email Reply Suggestions

### Objective
Build an algorithm that can analyze the tone and content of an incoming email to suggest appropriate responses.

### Solution
- **NLP Integration:** The algorithm uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the spaCy API to understand the tone and content of the email.
- **Response Suggestions:** Based on the analysis, it suggests relevant and contextually appropriate responses.
- **User Interface:** Users can input emails into the interface, and the system provides suggestions for responses, saving time and ensuring consistency.

## Problem 5: Efficient File and Email Management

### Objectives
1. **Swiftly scan your Outlook inbox and file repositories to locate specific emails or documents.**
2. **Manage a large influx of emails by prioritizing them based on urgency and relevance, and suggest actions like reply, delegate, or schedule a follow-up.**
3. **Automate email drafting by suggesting relevant content for composing emails based on context and user preferences.**

### Solutions
1. **Outlook Inbox and File Repository Scanning:**
   - **Algorithm:** Developed an algorithm that scans the Outlook inbox and file repositories to locate specific emails or documents.
   - **Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for endless scrolling or manual searches by quickly identifying and retrieving required information.

2. **Email Overload Management:**
   - **AI Prioritization:** The AI system categorizes and prioritizes incoming emails based on urgency and relevance.
   - **Action Suggestions:** Suggests actions such as replying, delegating, or scheduling a follow-up to help manage the email influx efficiently.

3. **Automated Email Drafting:**
   - **Content Suggestions:** Uses AI to analyze the context and user preferences, providing relevant content suggestions for composing emails.
   - **Draft Automation:** Facilitates quicker and more accurate email drafting, enhancing productivity.
